  Hi! 

We have 2 communication platforms:

 <h3 level="3">
  <strong>
   1. Coursera Discussion Forums
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p>
  Here, you will find dedicated mentors who provide academic support for this course. They do this by answering questions, explaining concepts, giving feedback, and sharing resources in the course forums.

   Slack
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p>
  The slack channel is a community for learners to meet other learners from around the world, ask questions, discuss ideas and work together.
You can pair up with learners that have similar interests. For example paper discussions, kaggle competitions, hackathons, share opportunities etc

In addition, you will learn about opportunities to work more directly with deeplearning.ai as mentors.
